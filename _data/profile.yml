     Hello, I am a Ph.D. student advised by Prof. <a href="https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/soltani/\" target="_blank">Iman Soltani</a> at <a href="https://soltanilab.engineering.ucdavis.edu" target="_blank">LARA</a>, University of California, Davis. 
  Before starting my Ph.D., I was a Masterâ€™s student at the same lab, and I received my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Hanyang University in Seoul, South Korea.
  </p>
  <p>
  As a researcher, I am passionate about <b>bridging the gap between robotics and human behavior</b>. Specifically, I am interested in (i) achieving <b>natural coordination between robot parts</b> (e.g., arms-arms, arms-body) and (ii) developing <b>human-like active perception</b> strategies for robots.
  </p>
  <p>
  Most recently, I have been exploring how Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can be leveraged to guide robots in acquiring human-like bahaviors.
  </p>

  <p style="color: #76236C;">
    <i>I am actively looking for <b>internship opportunities for 2025!</b> If you are interested in my research, please feel free to reach out to me.</i>
