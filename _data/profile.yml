     Hello, I am a Ph.D. student advised by Prof. <a href="https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/soltani/\" target="_blank">Iman Soltani</a> at <a href="https://soltanilab.engineering.ucdavis.edu" target="_blank">LARA</a>, University of California, Davis.
  </p>
  <p>
  As a researcher, I am passionate about bridging the gap between robotics and human behavior. Specifically, I am interested in (i) leveraging insights from <span class="gradient-color">human behavior for robust robot learning</span> and (ii) developing <span class="gradient-color">human-like active perception</span> strategies for robots.
  </p>
  <p>
  Most recently, I have been exploring how Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can be leveraged to guide robots in learning human-like behaviors.
  </p>
  <blockquote>I am actively looking for <b>internship opportunities for 2025!</b> If you are interested in my research, please feel free to reach out to me.</blockquote>
