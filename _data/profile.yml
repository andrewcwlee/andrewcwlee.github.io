     Hello, I am a Ph.D. student advised by Prof. <a href="https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/soltani/\" target="_blank">Iman Soltani</a> at <a href="https://soltanilab.engineering.ucdavis.edu" target="_blank">LARA</a>, University of California, Davis.
  </p>
  <p>
  As a researcher, I am passionate about bridging the gap between robotics and human behavior. Specifically, I am interested in (i) leveraging insights from <span class="gradient-color">human behavior for robust robot learning</span> and (ii) developing <span class="gradient-color">human-like active perception</span> strategies for robots.
  </p>
  <p>I am always open for collaboration and discussion. Please feel free to reach out!</p>
