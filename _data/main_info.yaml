              I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the <a href="https://ucdavis.edu/">University of California, Davis</a>, where I am part of the <a href="https://soltanilab.engineering.ucdavis.edu">Laboratory for AI, Robotics and Automation (LARA)</a>, advised by <a href="https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/soltani/">Iman Soltani</a>. Previously, I received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from <a href="https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng/home">Hanyang University</a> in Seoul, South Korea.

              I am interested in making robots learn to manipulate objects and interact with the world in ways similar to humans, mimicking how we coordinate our arms and eyes to perform tasks.
