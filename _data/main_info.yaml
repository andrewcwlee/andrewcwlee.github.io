description: "<p>Hello 👋<br>
  I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the <a href=\"https://ucdavis.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">University of California, Davis</a>, where I am part of the <a href=\"https://soltanilab.engineering.ucdavis.edu\" target=\"_blank\">Laboratory for AI, Robotics and Automation (LARA)</a>, under the guidance of <a href=\"https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/soltani/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Iman Soltani</a>. Before starting my Ph.D., I was a Master’s student at the same lab, and I received my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from <a href=\"https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng/home\" target=\"_blank\">Hanyang University</a> in Seoul, South Korea. <br><br>
  My research focuses on developing intelligent and adaptive robotic systems capable of <b>mimicking \"real\" human behavior and dexterity</b> in complex and unstructured environments. In that regard, my recent works are aimed at bimanual coordination and human-like perception.
  I am deeply passionate about advancing the fields of robotics and AI, and I welcome opportunities for collaboration and innovation. <br><br>
  Aside from research, I have a passion for photography, especially <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_photography\" target=\"_blank\">street photography</a>. It’s my way of reconnecting with the human side of things in this <b>🌪️ whirlwind 🌪️ of technology</b>—capturing moments that no algorithm could ever predict.
