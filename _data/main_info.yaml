            <p> 
             My work is driven by the goal of creating more intelligent and adaptive robotic systems that closely mimic human behavior and dexterity in complex, unstructured environments. 
             <br>
             I am passionate about advancing the frontiers of robotics and AI, and I am always open to discussing collaboration opportunities and innovative ideas in the field.
