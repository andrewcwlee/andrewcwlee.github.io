        <p style="text-align:left;">Humans naturally move their heads and bodies to get a better view of both their environment and objectives. When this behavior is transferred to robots, it greatly improves their ability to handle complex tasks. While traditional static camera setups often fail to provide the necessary visibility for intricate operations, robots with dynamic camera adjustment can actively seek better viewpoints, focusing on crucial visual information. This enables them to adapt more effectively to changing environments, resulting in greater precision in manipulationâ€”particularly in scenarios with occlusions or delicate object handling.</p>
